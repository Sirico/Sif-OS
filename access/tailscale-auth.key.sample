# tailscale auth key sample (do NOT commit real keys to the repo)
# To create a key that can be used for automatic device enrollment, use
# the Tailscale admin console to generate an auth key with appropriate expiry/ACL.
# Save the key (single line) as `access/tailscale-auth.key` on the workstation
# or the target device before running `nixos-rebuild switch`.

# Example (not valid):
# tskey-auth-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
